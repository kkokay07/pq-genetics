## Description  
This repository contains instructions and scripts for analyzing population genetics and quantitative genetics metrics. It includes the following:  

- **Inbreeding Coefficients**  
  - F_GRM (Genomic Relationship Matrix-based inbreeding)  
  - F_UNI (Inbreeding based on correlation between uniting gametes)  
  - F_HOM (Homozygosity-based inbreeding)  

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **Effective Population Size (Ne)**  *(coming soon)*

- **Genetic Diversity Metrics**  *(coming soon)* 
  - Observed and Expected Heterozygosity (H_O, H_E)  
  - Allelic Richness  
  - Fixation Index (F_ST, G_ST)  

- **Population Differentiation**  *(coming soon)* 
  - Pairwise F_ST  
  - AMOVA (Analysis of Molecular Variance)  

- **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD)**  *(coming soon)* 
  - LD decay analysis  
  - r² and D' metrics  

- **Admixture and Ancestry Analysis** *(coming soon)*  

- **Selection Signatures**  *(coming soon)* 
  - iHS (Integrated Haplotype Score)  
  - XP-EHH (Cross-Population Extended Haplotype Homozygosity)  
  - Tajima's D  

- **Quantitative Genetics Metrics**  *(coming soon)* 
  - Additive Genetic Variance (σ²A)  
  - Breeding Values (GEBV/EBV)  
  - Heritability (h²) estimates  
  - Genetic Correlations  

- **Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)**

- **Runs of Homozygosity (ROH)** analysis *(coming soon)*  
  - ROH segments  
  - ROH-based diversity metrics  

This repository is regularly updated with scripts, examples, and instructions for these metrics. Stay tuned for new additions!
