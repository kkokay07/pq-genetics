**Repository for Population Genetics and Quantitative Genetics Metrics Implementation and Visualization**  

---

## Description  
This repository contains scripts, datasets, and tools for analyzing population genetics and quantitative genetics metrics. It includes the following:  

- Implementation of various metrics for inbreeding coefficients (e.g., F_GRM, F_UNI, F_HOM).  
- Scripts for analyzing and visualizing population-specific metrics.  
- Step-by-step descriptions and documentation for running specific analyses.

## Folder Structure  

Each folder corresponds to a specific analysis or metric:  
1. **Inbreeding Coefficients (F_GRM, F_UNI, F_HOM):** Contains scripts and data for calculating and visualizing inbreeding coefficients using tools like PLINK.  
2. **Folders for other metrics are created shortly:** Connect with me through kkokay07@gmail.com and order me which metric you want to find out. I will make ready to run codes along with instructions.
