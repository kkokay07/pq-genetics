## Description  
This repository contains scripts, datasets, and tools for analyzing population genetics and quantitative genetics metrics. It includes the following:  

- Implementation of various metrics for inbreeding coefficients (e.g., F_GRM, F_UNI, F_HOM).  

**Note:** 
If you need any other population and quantitative genetics metrics which is not documented here, feel free to reach out!

- Email: **kkokay07@gmail.com**  
- Ask me any metric you want to calculate, and I will provide ready-to-run codes along with detailed instructions.
